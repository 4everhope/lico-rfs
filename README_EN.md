## Introduction

A simple example. Convert an old oven into a very good reflow equipment! For DIY PCB component soldering!

## Features

1. Thermocouple + microcontroller + relay closed-loop control
2. Simple modification, good soldering effect
3. Self-tuning PID example, quickly get PID parameters. 4.
4. computer control, temperature data visualization


## 🛠 Hardware requirements

### Bill of materials
- A used oven, preferably with built-in fan circulation (optional, can be added later if not), preferably with heating tubes on top and bottom (optional, can be used if not).
- Support Arduino microcontroller, need to support SPI (thermocouple use), this example uses the ESP32-WROOM-32D development board
- MAX6675 Thermocouple Module (SPI)
- Solid State Relay (Recommended to use 10-15A rated current, ***be sure to add a heat sink!!!! ***)
- 20A Fuse
- Silicone Tubing (High Temperature Insulation)
- High temperature polyimide tape
- Fiberglass braided high temperature wire (optional, preferably greater than 14AWG)

### Tool List
- Multimeter
- Screwdriver
- Pliers
- Wire stripper
- Soldering iron (optional)

### Other
- Knowledge of safe operation!!!
- A heart that loves/tosses
